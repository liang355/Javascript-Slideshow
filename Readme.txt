Dear grader:
The program is pretty robust. Feel free to play around it.

1. While the slide show is playing, you can click thumbnails but not the “start”,”next”,”previous” button.
2. The “fade in/out” animation shows up slightly later than the red border because of the animation delay. But they are pointing to the same object(image).
